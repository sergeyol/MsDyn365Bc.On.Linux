"""
resolve-keep-app-ids.py — Compute the BC_KEEP_APP_IDS set for a consumer
project so the BC container can selectively uninstall stock extensions
the project does NOT depend on, dramatically improving startup time.

Inputs:
  --app-json <path>     Path to a consumer app.json (may be repeated)
  --app-file <path>     Path to a consumer .app file (may be repeated)
  --artifact-dir <path> BC artifact root that contains stock extensions
                         (e.g. .../artifact-cache/27.5)
  --extra-ids <list>    Comma-separated GUIDs to always include on top
                         of the baseline + dependency closure (optional)
  --extra-app-name <n>  Name of an artifact app to keep, with its own
                         dependencies (may be repeated). For apps that a
                         Windows container has installed but no consumer
                         declares, e.g. Tests-TestLibraries (issue #125).

Output:
  Comma-separated lowercase GUIDs to stdout — feed straight into
  BC_KEEP_APP_IDS for `BC_CLEAR_ALL_APPS=selective`.

Logic:
  baseline ∪ extras ∪ transitive_closure(consumer_immediate_deps,
                                          available_artifact_apps)

The baseline is ALWAYS included, even if --app-json / --app-file are
empty or fail to parse, so the container can never accidentally clear
an app the project might secretly depend on. The five baseline apps
(System, System Application, Business Foundation, Base Application,
Application umbrella) are stable across BC versions per Microsoft
convention.

# ── Baseline (always kept) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Stable across BC versions. Including any of these in BC_KEEP_APP_IDS is
# harmless even if the app is not actually published in this BC build —
# the entrypoint's keep filter just won't match it.
#
# Includes ONLY the application stack (System / System Application /
# Business Foundation / Base Application / Application umbrella). The test
# framework apps are NOT in the baseline because they're handled separately
# by the entrypoint's "Publishing test framework" step (entrypoint.sh:864),
# which deletes them via SQL filter and then does a fresh install via the
# dev endpoint after NST starts. If we kept them in the SQL filter, the
# republish step would see them as "already deployed" (HTTP 422) and
# skip the install — leaving them in a published-but-not-installed-for-
# tenant-default state which then breaks the consumer's test app publish
# with "Library Assert ... is not installed" cryptic errors.

# ── Test framework apps (kept in the closure when consumers depend on them) ──
#
# Historical note: this set used to be deliberately EXCLUDED from the
# transitive closure, on the theory that the entrypoint's
# "Publishing test framework" republish step would freshly install them
# after NST starts. That republish step was a hand-curated array which
# we kept patching every time a consumer hit a missing dep — and the
# discovery loop was painful (silent install failures, "0 tests ran"
# with no clue, multiple cycles of "find missing dep, add to array,
# rebuild image, retry").
#
# The right architecture is to never wipe them in the first place. The
# selective filter now keeps everything in the consumer's transitive
# closure, including any test framework apps the consumer reaches via
# its dependency chain. The entrypoint no longer needs to republish
# anything from this set.
